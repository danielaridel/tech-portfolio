Hello!

I'm Daniela, 
I was born and raised in Brazil, I had the opportunity to study abroad in England, Germany, and United States. I have been passionate about Computer Science since my first programming class.

During my master I worked with stereo/mono cameras to solve obstacle detection and tracking applied to self-driving cars. Currently I have been researching about Long-Term Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting using Deep Learning.

I want to keep learning and solving complex problems, and I'll never miss the opportunity of inspiring some girls on the way.
